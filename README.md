# Evaluator RDA maDMP for OpenCDMP

**evaluator-rda-madmp** is an implementation of the `evaluator-base` package designed to evaluate **JSON exports** of Data Management Plans (DMPs) against the **[RDA DMP Common Standard for machine-actionable Data Management Plans (maDMPs)](https://github.com/RDA-DMP-Common/RDA-DMP-Common-Standard)**. This evaluator checks whether a plan or description conforms to the **[RDA DMP Common Standard](https://github.com/RDA-DMP-Common/RDA-DMP-Common-Standard)** JSON schema.

## Overview

The **evaluator-rda-madmp** service evaluates the compliance of exported Plans and Descriptions with the **RDA DMP Common Standard**. It ensures that plans and descriptions generated by OpenCDMP adhere to the standards for machine-actionable DMPs, providing a rank and validation feedback based on the JSON schema defined by the RDA.

- **Evaluations**: Supported for both **plans** and **descriptions** exported in JSON format.
- **Schema Validation**: Evaluates plans and descriptions against the official **RDA DMP Common Standard** JSON schema.
- **Spring Boot Microservice**: Built as a Spring Boot microservice for seamless integration with OpenCDMP.

## Features

- **JSON Evaluation**: Validate and rank DMPs and descriptions exported to RDA-compliant JSON.
- **Schema Compliance**: Checks whether the plan or description adheres to the RDA DMP Common Standard for maDMPs.
- **Spring Boot Microservice**: Built as a Spring Boot microservice for integration with the OpenCDMP platform.
- **Ranking Mechanism**: Provides a rank based on the conformance of the JSON structure.
